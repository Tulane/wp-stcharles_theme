# "St. Charles" Theme

This repo contains a WordPress theme built to support "Gutenberg" blocks of the [Tulane Sites] platform. This theme includes many modern standards for developing/designing websites. We've created [a directory of different sites] using the theme.

### Theme Highlights
- *Gutenberg Ready*: This theme is made for WordPress’s “[Gutenberg]” block editor. 
- *Extenable Structure*: Styles, scripts and PHP includes are organized so you can easily add particular content you need.
- *SASS-ready*: Key theme parts are segmented into corresponding SASS files.

### Getting Started
1. Install.
2. Activate.
3. Edit.

### Updating Styles
Lots of thought went into the structure in the `/styles` folder. We’re being explicit, while avoiding redundancy. All dependent styles are compiled into `styles.scss`. Checkout the notes in each `.scss` file.

### Required Plug-ins
To run the theme properly, you'll need the [Gutenberg] plugin and the latest version of WordPress. [Advanced Custom Fields] is also required to hide and show content titles. You also will need a SASS compiler to generate CSS from the SCSS. 

### Contributing
Feel free to pull, fork and manipulate.

### Issue Reporting and Questions
Issues and questions can be added under my open repo's [“Issues" tab]. 

This theme is currently developed by me, [@bbertucc], and [Decubing] with [Tulane Technology Services].

Happy hacking!
